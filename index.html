                It is listed as least concern by the IUCN.
                 Its range has increased alongside human expansion,
                  having been introduced to Australia, where it is considered harmful
                   to native mammals and bird populations.

            <p >
                Due to its presence in Australia,
                it is included on the list of the "world's 100 worst invasive species".
            </p>

            <p>
                The red fox originated from smaller-sized ancestors from Eurasia
                 during the Middle Villafranchian period, and colonised North America
                  shortly after the Wisconsin glaciation.
                  Among the true foxes, the red fox represents a more progressive form in the direction of carnivory.
